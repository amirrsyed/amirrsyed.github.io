  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p><b>EnergEyes.org</b></p>
    <p>In 2022, Syed founded EnergEyes.org, a business dedicated to decarbonizing the world through net-gain carbon offset investment.  EnergEyes.org enables companies to achieve and market the Net Zero status, increasing WTP and embracing environmentalism through financial benefit rather than advocacy.  After attending a two-week long international business seminar for ambitious high schoolers in the summer, Syed assembled a highly skilled team which now works on improving environmental technology and developing business partnerships with enterprise customers.  EnergEyes.org began as a way to quell climate concerns so that AI technology can accelerate unabated.  The company provides (1) software for organizations to calculate emissions and (2) affordable, audited carbon offsets generated using proprietary methodologies.  EnergEyes.org has helped Syed experiment with environmental technology, learn about the modern startup/VC scene, and develop interpersonal management skills.</p>

  <p><b>IntelliGen</b></p>
    <p>In early 2024, Syed developed the proprietary IntelliGen software, a AI-centered project that uses machine learning to generate synthetic alternative data that is actionable and/or used to train new ML models.  IntelliGen gained notoriety on X, so Syed subsequently open sourced the codebase on GitHub (see code here <a href="https://github.com/amirrsyed/intelligen">https://github.com/amirrsyed/intelligen</a>).  IntelliGen is useful for HFT traders, quantitative hedge funds, and ML researchers.  Working on IntelliGen has made Syed passionate about the technical side of AI/ML and the useful, insightful, and lucrative possibilities that the technology creates.  Syed has trained ML models from public data sets and generated synthetic preprocessed data dealing with agricultural yield and weather conditions, image-to-text radiology, and financial market sentiment impact on pricing.</p>

  <p><b>GlideRide Suspension</b></p>
    <p>GlideRide is a simple, affordable, active-suspension prototype for vehicles.  It utilizes cheap LiDAR sensors, an onboard Arduino R3 microcontroller, and 1 degree of freedom servos to actively negate vertical displacement of a vehicle in rough terrain (creating active suspension). See it inaction here (link).  Syed developed GlideRide to explore the robotics space, exceed the high school AP Physics curriculum, and develop computer science skills.  GlideRide required learning inverse kinematics, the Arduino programming language, and basic robotics & firmware knowledge.
Interestingly, a fully-developed application of the technology, dubbed “SkyRide,” has been incorporated into the 2024 Nio ET9, a production-ready EV made by Chinese automobile manufacturer Nio.  See Nio’s video here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEr_sNp7XLM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEr_sNp7XLM</a>.</p>

  <p><b>AmirCoin</b></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/amirrsyed/amircoin">AmirCoin</a> is a simple, API-operated cryptocurrency written in Python. It utilizes a blockchain, cryptography, wallet management, and a simple API for interaction. It is not based on pre-existing blockchains, such as Ethereum, so it's transactions are not tracked by brokerage firms. No known compute ensures 100% uptime.</p>
