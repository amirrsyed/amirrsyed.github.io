  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p><b>EnergEyes.org</b></p>
    <p>In 2022, I founded EnergEyes.org, a B2B service dedicated to achieving decarbonization through enterprise Net Zero investment, as a way to embrace environmentalism through market forces rather than regulation.  Customers seek profit gains by investing in and marketing the Net Zero carbon emissions status.  Cofounded with Wharton summer program students, EnergEyes.org improves environmental technology and maintains enterprise partnerships.  The company provides (1) AI carbon emissions calculation software and (2) market-price, audited carbon offsets generated via proprietary methodologies. </p>

  <p><b>IntelliGen</b></p>
    <p>In early 2024, I developed the proprietary IntelliGen software that uses machine learning to generate synthetic alternative data.  Such alternative data is actionable and/or used as training data for other ML models in development.  IntelliGen gained notoriety on X.com, so I open sourced the codebase (<a href="https://github.com/amirrsyed/intelligen">https://github.com/amirrsyed/intelligen</a>).  IntelliGen is especially useful for quantitative hedge funds.  Available synthetic, preprocessed datasets deal with agricultural yield and weather conditions, image-to-text radiology, and financial market sentiment impact on asset pricing.</p>

  <p><b>GlideRide Suspension</b></p>
    <p>GlideRide is a simple, affordable, active-suspension prototype for vehicles.  It utilizes cheap LiDAR sensors, an onboard Arduino R3 microcontroller, and 1 degree of freedom servos to actively negate vertical displacement of a vehicle traversing rough terrain, creating active suspension.  See it inaction here ().  Interestingly, a fully-developed application of the technology, dubbed “SkyRide,” has been incorporated into the 2024 Nio ET9, a production-ready EV made by Chinese automobile manufacturer Nio.  See Nio’s video here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEr_sNp7XLM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEr_sNp7XLM</a>.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p><b>AmirCoin</b></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/amirrsyed/amircoin">AmirCoin</a> is a simple, API-operated cryptocurrency written in Python. It utilizes blockchain technology, cryptography, wallet management, and a simple API for interaction. It is not based on pre-existing blockchains, such as Ethereum, so it's transactions are not tracked by brokerage firms. No known compute ensures 100% uptime.</p>
