  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p><b>EnergEyes.org</b></p>
    <p>In 2022, I founded EnergEyes.org, a B2B service dedicated to achieving decarbonization through enterprise Net Zero investment, as a way to embrace environmentalism through market forces rather than regulation.  Customers seek profit gains by investing in and marketing the Net Zero carbon emissions status.  Cofounded with Wharton summer program students, EnergEyes.org improves environmental technology and maintains enterprise partnerships.  The company provides (1) AI carbon emissions calculation software and (2) market-price, audited carbon offsets generated via proprietary methodologies. </p>

  <p><b>IntelliGen</b></p>
    <p>In 2024, I developed IntelliGen, a software that uses machine learning to generate synthetic alternative datasets.  Intending to create a proof-of-concept, I open sourced the codebase (<a href="https://github.com/amirrsyed/intelligen">https://github.com/amirrsyed/intelligen</a>) and made all synthetic datasets publicly available (agricultural yield, image-to-text radiology, and market sentiment analysis.</p>

  <p><b>AmirCoin</b></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/amirrsyed/amircoin">AmirCoin</a> is a simple, API-operated cryptocurrency written in Python. It utilizes blockchain tech, cryptography, wallet management, and an API for interaction. It is not based on pre-existing blockchains, such as Ethereum, so it's transactions are not tracked by brokerage firms.  No known compute ensures 100% uptime.</p>
